6. What made you start Ren wife: 

    I think of the main focus --- tag line. 
    All the things we didn't learn when we were younger because we werew busy raising kids, working,a nd other things. Ren wife, arts, and heart blessings, talents, and skills werewn't high priorities. All those things we didn't learn we can still learn. 

    Original concept was physical house. Rent out rooms. TGo oeopel who could teach skilsl we didn't learn when we were younger. Like a cook, music, paint, dance, garnder, etc

    Having a ricker fuller life. Not necessary monetary but personal development. Realied it wasn't realistic so we decided to make a virtual place. Life got in the way and it didn't work out the way we wanted. 

    New vision -- not compartmentalized. "This is what I learned this week." Personal renassaince. Here is something you might want to do. Documenting my renaissance. 

    Inductive study -- asking journalist questions: What does it say, what does it mean, what do I do about it. Frame work. 

    Personal journey. 

    Include Book Reviews --- separate from blogging.
